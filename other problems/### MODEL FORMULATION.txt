### MODEL FORMULATION

#### SETS

- C = Set of Countries (each one represent a **node**). (to denote we use the subscript C.)
  
    - (**Destinations:** Ireland, Poland, Italy, Switzerland ; **In between:** France, Monaco, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany. **Origin**: Spain.)
  
- P = Set of connections (connected countries for flow). Shown as a set ($\text{country}_i , \text{country}_j$).




#### PARAMETERS

- Origin = source node, in our case **SPAIN**

- Maximum = maximum quantity of olive oil allowed to pass from country to country in pairs ($\text{country}_i \rightarrow \text{country}_j$) represented as **$M_{ij}$**.

- Needs = amount of olive oil required by importer countries. $N_{i}$.


#### VARIABLES

- $Flow_{ij}$ = flow between country *i* to country *j*
  
- For each pair of nodes $i,j \in C$ that are defined in P (as the explicit pairs allowed).
 
$$Flow_{ij}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\text{max flow} & \textrm{if there is flow $j$ right after node $i$}\\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.$$


#### OBJECTIVE FUNCTION

Objective function is to maximize the amount of olive oil arriving at the final nodes (importer countries $\in N$ ). Therefore, it is the total sum of the flow in every pair of countries **(connections)** that arrive to a final destination defined in the Needs Parameter (Ireland, Poland, Switzerland, Italy).

$$\text{max} \;\; \sum_{i,j\in P}^{} Flow_{ij}, \quad\forall j \in \text{Needs}$$


#### CONSTRAINTS

- 1. Flow of oil outward of each country (in each pair of connections in P) must be less than the maximum amount it has:

$$\forall{i,j \in C}, \;\text{for pairs ij} \in P,\quad  flow_{ij} \;\;\leq\;\; maximum_{ij}$$

- 2. **Flow Conservation Rule**. Flow into a node must be equal to the flow out of a node except if we are in source (Origin = Spain) or destination (Needs = Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Poland), to fulfill.
  

$$ \forall{b \in C}, \sum_{i \in P} Flow_{ib} = \sum_{j \in P} Flow_{bj} \;\;\text{iff}\;\; b\neq j, \;j \in \text{Needs} \;\text{or} \;\;i \in \text{Origin} $$


- 3. We must ensure that that importer countries receive at least their required amount of oil pacted in the agreement.


$$\forall{b \in C}, \sum_{b,j \in C} Flow_{bj} \geq \text{Needs}_j$$
